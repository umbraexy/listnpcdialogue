# listnpcdialogue
After learning about lists, I thought about a way to use it in a way that would be interesting to me. So, I made this script in which you are basically responding to NPC's questions. If you answer positively, a weapon will be added to your inventory (append to list). If not, you will lose one weapon in your inventory.
